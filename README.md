# ⚖️ Epstein Files RAG MVP

A public, free-to-access AI research assistant for exploring the **Epstein Files** (`teyler/epstein-files-20k` dataset).

This tool allows you to:

- **Ask questions** about the files and get fact-based answers.
- **View Sources**: Every answer is grounded in specific documents, with filenames provided.
- **Chat History**: Ask follow-up questions in a conversational interface.
- **Multiple Models**: Supports **Google Gemini** (Free), **xAI (Grok)**, and **Groq**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An API Key (One of):
  - **Google Gemini** (Free tier available)
  - **xAI (Grok)**
  - **Groq**

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/epstein-rag.git
cd epstein-rag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Optional: Pre-set your keys here (or enter them in the UI)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_grok_or_groq_key_here
```

### 4. Ingest Data (First Run Only)

Download and index the dataset (this creates the local vector database):

```bash
python ingest.py
```

*Note: This processes the dataset from Hugging Face. It may take a few minutes.*

### 5. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
